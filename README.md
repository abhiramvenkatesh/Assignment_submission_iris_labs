Question 2:
  In this question we have made into the mealy and moore machine. The major difference between the mealy and moore is that in mealy it checks for the next input and directly generates the output where as in moore machine the output is dependent on the states once the state is reached then only the output is generated. Both the codes and vivado files are uploaded.
