# Question 1: 
In this question we need to rotate the n bit number by any number of times, so we use the concept of the universal shift register which had had four options rotate right, rotate left , load the data and the serial out of the data. Now we see the internal structure of the Universal shift register. And convert the d flip flop in terms of the 2:1 MUX and also we use only two operations one is the loading operation which is done by parallel loading and the next operation is the rotating operation. There is a logi sim and a verilog file and a verilog code will be uploaded
# Question 2: 
In this question we have made into the mealy and moore machine. The major difference between the mealy and moore is that in mealy it checks for the next input and directly generates the output where as in moore machine the output is dependent on the states once the state is reached then only the output is generated. Both the codes and vivado files are uploaded.
# Question 3:
In this question we use the concept of the frequency divider. First we use the counter for the frequency division and add a D flip flop for normalizing the f/7 condition. Here a logi sim circuit and a circuit diagram and a vedeio is uploaded.
