# Question 1: 
In this question we need to rotate the n bit number by any number of times, so we use the concept of the universal shift register which had had four options rotate right, rotate left , load the data and the serial out of the data. Now we see the internal structure of the Universal shift register. And convert the d flip flop in terms of the 2:1 MUX and also we use only two operations one is the loading operation which is done by parallel loading and the next operation is the rotating operation. There is a logi sim and a verilog file and a verilog code will be uploaded
